# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

## Introduction

Welcome to my repository containing my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). Advent of Code is an annual set of programming puzzles that can be solved in any programming language. This repository documents my journey through these challenges.

## Project Structure

Each day will have its own folder, named `day1`, `day2`, etc.
Each day's challenge is solved in a separate Python script named `problem1.py`, `problem2.py`, etc., corresponding to the problem number.

## Getting Started

To run these scripts, you will need Python installed on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or above
- Any additional libraries (if used) are listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Treadgold/Advent_2023.git
